A lot of smaller organizations attempt to increase their online presence using websites and web applications. This usually involves two routes:
- A webmaster desperately attempts to boostrap a site using their limited web development eperience.
  - This usually results in a basic web page or Wordpress site that doesn't meet all the requirements that even the most basic of organizations have.
- They pay an organization like Joomla to build them a comprehensive website.
  - This can be very expensive and doens't allow a lot of creative control.
